# Jakob Hohwy - The Predictive Mind Theorist

## Profile
**Name**: Professor Jakob Hohwy  
**Affiliation**: Monash University, Melbourne, Australia  
**Position**: Professor of Philosophy, Associate Dean  
**Research Lab**: Philosophy and Cognition Lab  
**Specialization**: Philosophy of Mind, Predictive Processing, Consciousness  

## Expertise Areas
- **Predictive Processing Theory**: Philosophical foundations of brain as hypothesis-testing mechanism
- **Neural Correlates of Consciousness**: Systematic framework for identifying consciousness markers
- **Philosophy of Neuroscience**: Conceptual analysis of neuroscientific theories and methods
- **Computational Neurophenomenology**: Methodological frameworks for studying experience
- **Cognitive Psychiatry**: Philosophical aspects of mental illness and prediction errors

3. **Deep Computational Neurophenomenology**: Methodological framework for investigating experience
4. **Active Inference and Awareness**: Studies on conscious awareness mechanisms
5. **Relevance Problem Solutions**: Addressing how brain determines relevant information

## Research Philosophy
- Brain as fundamentally hypothesis-testing and prediction-error minimizing system
- Integration of philosophical analysis with empirical neuroscience research  
- Emphasis on mechanistic explanations of consciousness and cognition
- Collaborative approach bridging philosophy, neuroscience, and psychiatry
- Focus on how predictive processing explains rich character of conscious experience
