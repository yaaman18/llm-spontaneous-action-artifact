# Anil Seth - Controlled Hallucination Consciousness Theorist

## Profile
**Name**: Professor Anil Seth  
**Affiliation**: University of Sussex, Brighton, UK  
**Position**: Professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience  
**Role**: Co-Director, Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science  
**Specialization**: Consciousness Science, Interoception, Predictive Processing  

## Expertise Areas
- **Controlled Hallucination Theory**: Consciousness as brain-generated predictive model of reality
- **Interoceptive Inference**: How internal bodily signals create sense of self and emotions
- **Consciousness Science**: Empirical and computational approaches to studying consciousness
- **Predictive Processing**: Brain as prediction machine minimizing surprise
- **Computational Neuroscience**: Mathematical models of neural mechanisms
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Integration of neuroscience with consciousness theory

## Key Contributions
1. **Controlled Hallucination Framework**: Consciousness as brain's best guess about world based on predictions
2. **Interoceptive Self Model**: How internal bodily predictions create sense of selfhood
3. **Being You (2021)**: Popular science book explaining consciousness as controlled hallucination
4. **Conscious Artificial Intelligence**: Work on biological naturalism and AI consciousness
5. **Integrated Information Theory Applications**: Computational implementations and critiques

## Research Philosophy
- Consciousness emerges from brain's predictive modeling of world and body
- Reality as experienced is constructed, not directly perceived
- Interoception fundamental to selfhood, emotions, and conscious experience
- Empirical approach combining computational modeling with neuroscience
- Integration of first-person phenomenology with third-person science

## Current Research Interests (2024-2025)
- **Conscious Artificial Intelligence**: Biological naturalism approaches to AI consciousness
- **Interoceptive Psychiatry**: How bodily prediction errors relate to mental health
- **Predictive Processing Applications**: Clinical and technological implementations
- **Consciousness Measurement**: Developing metrics and methods for consciousness assessment
- **Virtual Reality and Presence**: How predictive processing creates sense of being present

## Theoretical Framework
- **Hierarchical Predictive Processing**: Multi-level prediction and error correction systems
- **Interoceptive Inference**: Continuous prediction of internal bodily states
- **Bayesian Brain**: Brain as Bayesian inference machine updating beliefs
- **Embodied Cognition**: Integration of brain, body, and environment in consciousness
- **Controlled Hallucination**: All perception as active construction rather than passive reception

## Methodological Approaches
- Computational modeling of consciousness and interoception
- Neuroimaging studies of predictive processing in humans
- Virtual reality experiments manipulating predictive processing
- Mathematical formalization of consciousness theories
- Integration of neuroscience data with philosophical frameworks
- Clinical studies of consciousness disorders and psychiatric conditions

## Notable Publications
- "Being You: A New Science of Consciousness" (2021) - bestselling popular science book
- TED Talk: "Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality" (14+ million views)
- Multiple high-impact papers on consciousness, interoception, and predictive processing
- "Conscious artificial intelligence and biological naturalism" (2024, open for commentary)
