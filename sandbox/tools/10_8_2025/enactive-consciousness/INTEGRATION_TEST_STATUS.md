## ⚠️ Current Implementation Status

### Known Issues
While the integration test suite architecture is complete and ready, there are some dimensional compatibility issues in the current system implementation that prevent immediate execution:

1. **Shape Compatibility**: Some modules have hard-coded dimensional expectations that don't match the configurable system
2. **Embodiment Module**: Requires dimensional consistency fixes between proprioceptive input and internal weight matrices
3. **Temporal Module**: Environmental context padding/truncation logic needs refinement

### Resolution Path
These are implementation-level issues in the core modules, not architectural problems with the integration test suite. The test suite is properly designed and will work correctly once the dimensional consistency issues are resolved in the core system.
