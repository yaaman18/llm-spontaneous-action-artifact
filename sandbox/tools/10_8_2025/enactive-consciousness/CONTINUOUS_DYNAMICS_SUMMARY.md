### Mathematical Models

#### Husserlian Temporal Flow
```
dR/dt = -λ_r * R(t) + δ(t) * P(t-dt)  # Retention decay + impression flow
dP/dt = f_present(S(t), R(t), F(t))   # Present synthesis function  
dF/dt = λ_f * ∇F + g_anticipation(P(t), R(t))  # Protentional anticipation
```

#### Enactive Coupling
```
dA/dt = f_agent(A, E, M) + σ_A * dW_A  # Agent dynamics
dE/dt = g_env(A, E) + h_perturbation(t) + σ_E * dW_E  # Environment dynamics
dM/dt = emergence_dynamics(A, E, history) + σ_M * dW_M  # Meaning emergence
```

#### Neural ODE Consciousness
```
dx/dt = f_θ(x, t)  # Learnable dynamics function
```
