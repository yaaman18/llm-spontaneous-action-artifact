# Dynamic Networks for Enactive Consciousness

## Overview

The `dynamic_networks.py` module implements adaptive graph structures for enactive consciousness following Varela-Maturana principles of structural coupling and autopoiesis. This implementation provides sophisticated neural network dynamics that can reorganize based on experiential interactions.

## Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Graph Structures for Cognitive Reorganization

- **Multiple Network Topologies**: Small-world, scale-free, modular, hierarchical, and fully-connected networks
- **Dynamic Connectivity**: Networks can add/remove connections based on activity and coupling states
- **Topology-Specific Properties**: Each topology provides different consciousness characteristics and information processing capabilities

### 2. Graph Neural Networks for Meaning Emergence

- **Message Passing Framework**: JAX/Equinox-based graph neural networks for efficient processing
- **Node Feature Evolution**: Dynamic node representations that evolve through interactions
- **Edge Weight Adaptation**: Connection strengths adapt based on Hebbian, homeostatic, or circular causality principles
- **Global Feature Integration**: Network-level representations for consciousness assessment

### 3. Dynamic Connectivity Patterns for Agent-Environment Interaction

- **Circular Causality Adaptation**: Network structure influences activity, which influences structure
- **Coupling-Driven Reorganization**: Networks adapt based on agent-environment coupling states
- **Structural Plasticity**: Addition/removal of connections based on activity patterns
- **Homeostatic Regulation**: Maintains target activity levels through connection scaling

### 4. Network Metrics for Consciousness Assessment

- **Consciousness Scoring**: Integration, information, complexity, and differentiation measures
- **Network Analysis**: Clustering coefficient, density, degree distribution, small-worldness
- **Information Theory Integration**: Mutual information, transfer entropy, circular causality indices
- **Meaning Emergence Assessment**: Quantifies emergent meaning from network reorganization

## Architecture Implementation

### Clean Architecture Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - `DynamicNetworkProcessor`: Handles network dynamics and adaptation
   - `NetworkIntegrator`: Manages integration with coupling and temporal systems
   - `NetworkState`: Immutable state representation with validation
   - Separate adaptation mechanisms for different plasticity types

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - `AdaptationMechanism` enum allows new adaptation types without modifying existing code
   - `NetworkTopology` enum supports new topologies through extension
   - Protocol-based interfaces for extensibility

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - All adaptation mechanisms implement the same interface
   - Network topologies are interchangeable in the processor
   - Consistent state representations across different network types

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Focused protocols for different aspects of network processing
   - Separate concerns for topology creation, message passing, and adaptation
   - Clean separation between network metrics and consciousness assessment

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depends on abstract types and protocols rather than concrete implementations
   - Integration with existing framework through shared interfaces
   - JAX/Equinox abstractions for hardware-agnostic computation

## Integration with Existing System

### Circular Causality Integration

The dynamic networks module seamlessly integrates with the existing circular causality system:

```python
from enactive_consciousness import (
    DynamicNetworkProcessor,
    NetworkIntegrator,
    circular_causality_index
)

# Networks adapt based on coupling dynamics
result = network_processor.adaptive_reorganization(
    network_state,
    coupling_state,
    adaptation_mechanism=AdaptationMechanism.CIRCULAR_CAUSALITY
)

# Assess circular causality between network and environment
causality_metrics = circular_causality_index(
    network_time_series, environment_time_series
)
```

### Information Theory Integration

Leverages existing information theory measures for network analysis:

```python
from enactive_consciousness import (
    mutual_information_kraskov,
    complexity_measure,
    entropy_rate
)

# Network complexity assessment
complexity = complexity_measure(
    agent_network_states, environment_states
)

# Meaning emergence through mutual information
meaning_emergence = mutual_information_kraskov(
    old_network_features, new_network_features
)
```

### Temporal Integration

Networks can incorporate temporal moments for historically-informed adaptation:

```python
# Adaptive reorganization with temporal context
reorganization_result = network_processor.adaptive_reorganization(
    network_state,
    coupling_state,
    temporal_moment,  # Provides historical context
    AdaptationMechanism.CIRCULAR_CAUSALITY
)
```

## Varela-Maturana Principles Implementation

### 1. Structural Coupling
- Networks maintain structural coupling with environment through dynamic connectivity
- Coupling strength influences edge weight adaptations
- Stability metrics guide network reorganization

### 2. Autopoiesis
- Networks maintain their organization while adapting structure
- Self-referential dynamics through circular causality adaptation
- Autonomous reorganization based on internal activity patterns

### 3. Meaning Emergence
- Meaning emerges from network reorganization patterns
- Quantified through information-theoretic measures
- Assessed via consciousness-level changes

### 4. Circular Causality
- Network structure influences activity patterns
- Activity patterns influence structural changes
- Bidirectional causality captured in adaptation mechanisms
