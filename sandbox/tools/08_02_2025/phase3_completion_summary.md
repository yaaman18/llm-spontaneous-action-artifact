3. **Strategy Pattern** - Pluggable phi calculation algorithms
4. **Facade Pattern** - Simplified system interface
5. **Publisher-Subscriber** - Decoupled component communication
6. **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling via interfaces

## 🔧 Key Refactoring Solutions

### Before (Tightly Coupled):
```python
class ConsciousnessMonitor:
    def monitor(self):
        detector = ConsciousnessDetector()        # Direct coupling
        stage_manager = DevelopmentStageManager() # Direct coupling
        memory = ExperientialMemory()             # Direct coupling
        
        result = detector.detect()
        stage_manager.update_stage(result.phi)    # Direct method call
        memory.store_result(result)               # Direct method call
```

### After (Decoupled):
```python
class ConsciousnessMonitor:
    def __init__(self, event_bus: IEventBus):
        self._event_bus = event_bus
    
    async def monitor(self):
        result = await self._facade.process_consciousness_input(...)
        # All downstream processing triggered via events
        # Zero direct coupling between components
```

## 🚀 Architectural Benefits Achieved

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Zero direct method calls** between unrelated components
- **Asynchronous processing** for better performance
- **Event correlation** for tracking complex workflows

### 2. Complete Dependency Decoupling
- **Phi calculation** → **Consciousness detection**: Event-driven
- **Consciousness detection** → **Stage mapping**: Event-driven  
- **Stage mapping** → **Memory storage**: Event-driven
- **Memory storage** → **Development analysis**: Event-driven

### 3. Configuration Externalization
- **No hardcoded values** in business logic
- **Runtime configuration changes** via Configuration Service
- **Event notifications** for configuration updates

### 4. Strategy-Based Processing
- **Pluggable phi algorithms**: Standard IIT, Fast Approximation
- **Auto-selection** based on system characteristics
- **Runtime algorithm switching** without code changes

### 5. Error Isolation and Recovery
- **Component failures don't cascade** to other components
- **Event-driven error handling** with proper isolation
- **Graceful degradation** when components are unavailable

## 📈 Performance Impact

| Metric | Tightly Coupled | Decoupled | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Component Isolation | ❌ None | ✅ Complete | Infinite |
