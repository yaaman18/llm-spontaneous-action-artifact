üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
   1. üî¥ Poor Clean Architecture compliance - major refactoring required.
   2. üìã Address 7 Single Responsibility violations by breaking large classes/functions into smaller, focused units
   3. üîÑ Resolve 205 Dependency Inversion violations by using interfaces and dependency injection
   4. üèóÔ∏è  Fix 37 layer boundary violations by enforcing inward-only dependencies
