## Recommendations

1. Fix 35 layer dependency violations. Review import statements and apply Dependency Inversion.
2. Address 8 SRP violations. Consider class decomposition and Extract Class refactoring.
3. System not yet production-ready. Address critical violations and improve test coverage before deployment.
