## üîÑ TDD Methodology Implementation

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
```python
# RED: Write failing test first
def test_empty_system_phi():
    assert calculate_phi([], []) == 0.0  # Should fail initially

# GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
def calculate_phi(state, connectivity):
    if len(state) == 0:
        return 0.0  # Minimal fix
    return complex_calculation(state, connectivity)

# REFACTOR: Improve structure while maintaining tests
class PhiCalculator:
    def calculate_phi(self, state, connectivity):
        self._validate_inputs(state, connectivity)
        if self._is_empty_system(state):
            return self._create_empty_result()
        return self._complex_calculation(state, connectivity)
```

### Quality Metrics Achieved

```python
def check_coverage_gate(coverage_percentage: float) -> bool:
    return coverage_percentage >= 95.0
```

### Performance Gates
```python
def check_performance_gate(latency_ms: float, regression_count: int) -> bool:
    return latency_ms < 100.0 and regression_count <= 2
```

### Memory Gates
```python
def check_memory_gate(memory_growth_mb: float) -> bool:
    return memory_growth_mb < 10.0
```

### 1. Test Isolation
```python
# Each test runs in isolation with mocked dependencies
@patch('external_dependency', return_value=mock_result)
def test_isolated_functionality():
    result = function_under_test()
    assert result.success
```

### 2. Comprehensive Mocking
```python
# Mock external systems for predictable testing
with patch('psutil.cpu_percent', return_value=25.0), \
     patch('asyncio.sleep', new_callable=AsyncMock):
    # Test execution with controlled environment
```

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
```python
# Performance regression detection with baselines
def profile_operation(operation_name: str):
    baseline_time = load_baseline(operation_name)
    current_time = measure_execution_time()
    regression = (current_time - baseline_time) / baseline_time
    assert regression < 0.05  # 5% regression tolerance
```

### 4. Memory Profiling
```python
# Memory leak detection
tracemalloc.start()
execute_operations()
current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
assert peak < memory_threshold
```
