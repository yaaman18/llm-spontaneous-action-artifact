## TDD Principles Applied

### 1. **Test-First Development**
- All features driven by failing tests
- Tests serve as living documentation
- Behavior specification before implementation

### 2. **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**
- Strict adherence to TDD phases
- Minimal code to pass tests
- Continuous refactoring while maintaining green tests

### 3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for system behavior
- Edge case and error condition testing
- Performance and scalability testing

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
- Tests as design validation
- Interface usability verified through test usage
- Testability equals good design principle

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on abstractions, not concretions
